/*
 *  system_call.s  contains the system-call low-level handling routines.
 * This also contains the timer-interrupt handler, as some of the code is
 * the same. The hd- and flopppy-interrupts are also here.
 *
 * NOTE: This code handles signal-recognition, which happens every time
 * after a timer-interrupt and after each system call. Ordinary interrupts
 * don't handle signal-recognition, as that would clutter them up totally
 * unnecessarily.
 *
 * Stack layout in 'ret_from_system_call':
 *
 *	 0(%esp) - %eax
 *	 4(%esp) - %ebx
 *	 8(%esp) - %ecx
 *	 C(%esp) - %edx
 *	10(%esp) - %fs
 *	14(%esp) - %es
 *	18(%esp) - %ds
 *	1C(%esp) - %eip
 *	20(%esp) - %cs
 *	24(%esp) - %eflags
 *	28(%esp) - %oldesp
 *	2C(%esp) - %oldss
